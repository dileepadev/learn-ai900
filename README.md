# Learn AI-901

An interactive exam-prep app for **Exam AI-901: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals**, built for a
few-day study sprint rather than a leisurely course.

**→ [dileepadev.github.io/learn-ai901](https://dileepadev.github.io/learn-ai901/)**

It is not a documentation site. It is a learning loop:

> Learn → Interact → Answer → Get feedback → Identify weakness → Practise → Review → Simulate the exam → Improve

Everything is static. Progress lives in your browser. No backend, no account, no tracking.

## What's in it

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **12 lessons** | 3.8 hours total, in recommended study order, with 8 interactive demos and 79 inline knowledge checks |
| **206 questions** | 176 exam-style plus 30 inline checks. Multiple choice, multi-select, matching and ordering — each with an explanation, and a reason why each wrong option is wrong |
| **Spaced repetition** | A Leitner scheduler tuned for a sprint: intervals run from 8 minutes to 4 days, so the whole bank can resurface before exam day |
| **Weak-area drilling** | Topics ranked by *weighted readiness left on the table*, so a shaky high-weight topic outranks a neglected small one |
| **Mistakes mode** | Every question currently sitting on a wrong answer, in one place |
| **Exam simulator** | Timed, no feedback until the end, question palette with flagging, and a topic-by-topic report scaled to Microsoft's 1000-point scale |
| **Rapid review** | 69 flashcards with their own review schedule, 10 comparison drills with hidden cells, and 18 one-line facts |
| **Cram mode** | 19 "know this" callouts, 14 exam traps and 12 changed-since-AI-900 notes in one linear pass, for the final day |
| **Study plan** | A three-day sprint that ticks itself off as you work through it |

### The dashboard answers one question

> *"I have 30 minutes right now — what should I do?"*

Pick a time budget and it ranks concrete actions: finish the lesson you started, clear your
misses, drill your weakest weighted topic, work the review backlog, or sit a timed paper. The
first card is always the single highest-value thing you could do with that much time.

## Content accuracy

Written against the **skills measured as of April 15, 2026**, verified against Microsoft Learn
via the [official study guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/ai-901)
and current product documentation.

AI-901 replaced AI-900, and a lot of study material still in circulation is stale. Things this
app treats as current, and older material usually gets wrong:

- **Foundry resources and projects**, not AI hubs. Hub-based projects are the *classic* model;
  a Foundry project is a child of a Foundry resource and needs no separate Storage or Key Vault.
- **Prompt agents vs. hosted agents** — the two agent types in Foundry Agent Service — plus
  calling the Responses API directly for an ephemeral agent, and **toolboxes** for shared tools.
- **Two deployment options** (Serverless API, managed compute), with provisioned throughput as a
  deployment *type* rather than a third option, and **instant access** removing the deployment
  step for supported models.
- **Foundry IQ**: multi-source knowledge bases, agentic retrieval, permission-aware answers with
  citations.
- **Azure Content Understanding** across documents, images, audio and video — analyzers, the
  Extract / Classify / Generate field methods, and confidence-driven straight-through processing.
- The **GPT-image** family and **Sora-2**, not DALL·E alone; and Image Analysis 4.0's deprecation.
- Current naming: **Foundry Tools**, not Cognitive Services.

There is a whole section in cram mode dedicated to these, because they are where stale practice
questions will cost you marks.

The original markdown notes this repo started as are archived in
[`notes/`](./notes/README.md), with a table of exactly what in them is no longer true.

> These are practice questions written for this app, not real exam questions. Microsoft's own
> [practice assessment](https://aiskillsnavigator.microsoft.com/credentials/cert-83587e0a0754cfee561ade3e27d9fa1cdaf15ae03be52d2413b2b858d1b4eda4)
> is worth taking as well.

## Local development

Requires **Node 22.12 or later** (24 recommended) — Astro 7 sets that floor.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:4321/learn-ai901/
```

| Command | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `npm run dev` | Dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Type-check then build to `dist/` |
| `npm run build:fast` | Build without type-checking |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm run check` | Type-check `.astro` and `.svelte` files |
| `npm run test:smoke` | Drive the built site in a headless browser and verify the whole learning loop |

`test:smoke` needs the preview server running and a local Chrome or Chromium (set `CHROME_PATH`
if it is not on a standard path). It walks the dashboard, a lesson, a quiz, practice, the exam
simulator, rapid review, cram, the plan and the progress page — 56 assertions including
persistence, theme switching and mobile overflow. Worth running after editing content.

The dev server serves under `/learn-ai901/` because that is the GitHub Pages base path. To work
at the root instead:

```bash
BASE_PATH=/ npm run dev
```

---

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

The workflow in [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) builds and
deploys on every push to `main`.

**One-time setup:** in the repository, go to **Settings → Pages** and set **Source** to
**GitHub Actions**. Then push to `main`.

The site publishes to `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

### Base path

`astro.config.mjs` reads two environment variables, both set by the workflow:

```js
const base = process.env.BASE_PATH ?? '/learn-ai901';
const site = process.env.SITE_URL ?? 'https://dileepadev.github.io';
```

If you fork this, change `BASE_PATH` and `SITE_URL` in the workflow to match your repository.
For a **custom domain** or a **user site** (`<user>.github.io`), set `BASE_PATH: /` and put your
domain in `SITE_URL`.

All internal links are built from `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`, so nothing else needs changing.

```

Content and logic are kept apart on purpose. Adding a question means adding an object to a file
in `data/questions/`; nothing in `lib/` or `components/` needs to change.

### Adding content

**A question** — add it to the right file in `src/data/questions/`, or to a scenario bank:

```ts
{
  id: 'rai-023',                    // must be unique; the build fails on duplicates
  topic: 'responsible-ai',          // drives weighting and weak-area routing
  objective: 'Describe considerations for fairness in an AI solution',
  difficulty: 'medium',
  kind: 'exam',                     // 'exam' counts towards the practice exam; 'learn' does not
  scenario: 'Optional case setup shown above the question.',
  prompt: 'The question itself.',
  options: [
    { id: 'a', text: 'The right answer', correct: true },
    { id: 'b', text: 'A plausible one', correct: false, why: 'Why it is wrong.' },
  ],
  explanation: 'Why the correct answer is correct.',
  reference: { label: 'Microsoft Learn', url: 'https://learn.microsoft.com/...' },
}
```

`type` may be omitted for ordinary single-answer questions. Use `type: 'multi'`, `'match'` or
`'order'` for the others.

**A lesson** — add a module in `src/data/modules/` and register it in that folder's `index.ts`.
Lessons are arrays of typed blocks: `p`, `list`, `table`, `code`, `key`, `trap`, `changed`,
`steps`, `demo` and `check`.

The build **fails** on a duplicate question id, a single-answer question without exactly one
correct option, or a lesson referencing a question id that does not exist — so broken content
never ships.

### Progress and privacy

Everything is stored under one `localStorage` key in your browser. Clearing site data clears it.
There is an export/import backup on the [progress page](https://dileepadev.github.io/learn-ai901/progress/)
if you need to move between devices.
